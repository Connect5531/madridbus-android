Public transport application for Madrid buses

This app is a total revamp of the existing Madrid Bus app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quoders.apps.MadridBus
The current Madrid Bus is an old app, with aged UI and really nasty plumbers that was one of the first application we made mainly for
learning purposes.

The idea behind this new project is to build from the scratch the app, using modern Android UI, architecture, patterns and practices 
that hopefully will help others developers in the learning process of creating Android apps.

The progress of this project, technical explanations, decisions, etc. will be published in my blog https://davidguerrerodiaz.wordpress.com/
